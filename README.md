## 🎯 Project Vision
This project aims to build a reliable and trustworthy AI-powered assistant for farmers. It addresses the critical challenges of low internet connectivity and the need for transparent, explainable advice. By leveraging the on-device capabilities of Google's Gemma 3n and a novel RAG-based fallback system, KrishiSahayak+Gemma provides instant, accurate, and verifiable crop disease diagnosis and remedies.

## ✨ Core Features
- **100% Offline Functionality:** Works in the field, without needing an internet connection.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Provides diagnoses backed by trusted, cited sources (e.g., ICAR) to build farmer trust.
- **Adaptive Intelligence:** Uses an uncertainty module to recognize when it's unsure and falls back to a local knowledge base for a more reliable answer.
- **Multimodal Input:** Accepts both images of plant leaves and voice queries in local languages.
- **Lightweight & Efficient:** Designed to run on low-resource smartphones (2-4GB RAM).
