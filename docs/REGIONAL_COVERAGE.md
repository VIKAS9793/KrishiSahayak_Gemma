# Regional Coverage Strategy

This document outlines the strategic, phased approach to data localization for the KrishiSahayak project.

## 1. MVP Development Phase (Current)

To accelerate the development and technical validation of the core Android application, the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will utilize a generic, 46-class dataset.

- **Objective**: To build and test the offline technology stack (inference engine, database loading, RAG system) without being blocked by the long-term data curation process.
- **Data Used**: `knowledge_base_v0_generic_46-class`
- **Outcome**: A functionally complete application ready for integration with high-quality, localized data.

## 2. Pilot Phase: Focused Regional Data Curation

Following the successful development of the MVP, the project will enter a pilot phase focused on creating the first set of expert-curated, regional data packs. This effort will be concentrated on 6 strategically selected Indian states that represent diverse agricultural and climatic conditions.

### Initial Coverage Areas for Data Curation

| State | Region | Key Agricultural Focus |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| Maharashtra | Western India | Cotton, Sugarcane, Soybean, Pulses |
| Uttar Pradesh | Northern Plains | Wheat, Rice, Sugarcane, Pulses |
| Punjab | Northwest India | Wheat, Rice, Maize |
| Himachal Pradesh | Himalayan Region | Apple, Stone Fruits, Off-season Vegetables |
| Jammu & Kashmir | Mountainous Region | Apple, Saffron, Walnuts |
| Ladakh | Cold Desert | Apricots, Apples, Barley |

## 3. Future Expansion Roadmap

Based on the success of the pilot phase, the project will expand its regional coverage.

### Phase 2: Regional Expansion (6-12 months post-pilot)
- **Southern India**: Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala
- **Eastern India**: West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar

### Phase 3: National Coverage (12-24 months post-pilot)
- Remaining states and union territories.

## 4. Methodology for Regional Data Pack Creation

All future regional data packs will be created using a strict, manual, expert-led curation process.

1. **Data Collection**: Information will be sourced directly from authoritative bodies like state agricultural departments and universities.
2. **Verification**: All data will be validated by collaborating agricultural scientists and researchers to ensure accuracy and local relevance. No AI-generated data will be used.
3. **Field Testing**: The curated data packs will be tested with local farmers in the respective regions to gather feedback and ensure practical value.
