## 1. Project Overview

The KrishiSahayak+Gemma project is an engineering initiative to deliver a **100% offline, reliable, and user-friendly Android application** that operates efficiently on low-resource smartphones (â‰¤ 2GB RAM) for farmers in India.

For more details on the project vision and strategy, see [STRATEGY_AND_ROADMAP.md](STRATEGY_AND_ROADMAP.md).

## 2. System Architecture

The project follows a dual-track development approach to balance rapid prototyping with production readiness:

### 2.1 Development Tools

A web-based development interface for testing and validating the AI pipeline. See [web_demo/README.md](../web_demo/README.md) for details.

### 2.2 Production System

The primary goal of the project. A native Android app using a pre-quantized `.gguf` model and the `llama.cpp` C++ engine for maximum offline performance.

The project follows a dual-track development approach to balance rapid prototyping with production readiness.

* **AI Pipeline:** A robust AI processing pipeline using the Hugging Face `transformers` library to demonstrate the core AI capabilities.

* **Android Production App:** The primary goal of the project. A native Android app using a pre-quantized `.gguf` model and the `llama.cpp` C++ engine for maximum offline performance.

## 3. Core AI Asset for Android: `gemma-3n-q4_k_m.gguf`

The central component of the Android application is a highly optimized version of Google's Gemma model.

* **Model File:** `gemma-3n-q4_k_m.gguf`
* **Base Model:** `google/gemma-3n-E2B-it` (4.46 Billion Parameters)
* **Quantization:** 4-bit (`Q4_K_M`)
* **Final Size:** **2.60 GiB** (a 68.7% reduction from the 8.31 GiB FP16 version)
* **Performance:** While the total task time is slightly longer due to the initial dequantization overhead on the CPU, the massive reduction in file size is the critical optimization for mobile deployment.

## 4. Data Strategy

The project has adopted a phased data strategy to de-risk development and ensure the final data quality is exceptionally high.

### 4.1 MVP Development

To accelerate development, the initial Android MVP will be built using the generic **46-class dataset** (`knowledge_base_v0_generic_46-class`). This allows us to build and test the core offline technology stack without being blocked by the long data curation timeline.

### 4.2 Production Approach

The final, production-ready solution will use **expert-curated Regional Data Packs**. This will be a separate, future phase involving manual curation with agricultural scientists to ensure the highest level of accuracy. **No AI-generated data will be used in the final production knowledge base.**

For detailed regional coverage strategy, see [REGIONAL_COVERAGE.md](REGIONAL_COVERAGE.md).

* **Initial Approach (MVP Development):** To accelerate development, the initial Android MVP will be built using the generic **46-class dataset** (`knowledge_base_v0_generic_46-class`). This allows us to build and test the core offline technology stack without being blocked by the long data curation timeline.
* **Production Approach (Future Scope):** The final, production-ready solution will use **expert-curated Regional Data Packs**. This will be a separate, future phase involving manual curation with agricultural scientists to ensure the highest level of accuracy. **No AI-generated data will be used in the final production knowledge base.**

## 5. Reliability: RAG Fallback System

The application implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enhance reliability.

* **Uncertainty Detection:** A module (`uncertainty.py`) analyzes the model's initial response for signs of low confidence.
* **Contextual Retrieval:** If uncertainty is detected, the system performs a semantic search on the local `.faiss` index to retrieve relevant, verified text chunks.
* **Reprompting:** The original query is combined with the retrieved context and sent back to the model for a final, source-grounded diagnosis.

## 7. Next Steps

* **Current Status:** **Phase 1 (Asset Production & Optimization) is complete.**
* **Next Step:** **Phase 2 (Android App Development).** The focus now shifts to building the native Android application and integrating the validated AI assets using the generic dataset for initial functionality.
