- Ensures component separation (inference engine, FAISS search, image processor)
- Designs low-latency, memory-safe modules
- Prevents architectural bloat

### 3. MLOps & Model Engineer
- Optimizes 4-bit quantized inference (Gemma-3n E2B)
- Manages TFLite/ONNX conversions
- Ensures lightweight, GPU-free ML components
- Validates on-device compatibility

### 4. Security & Compliance Officer
- Enforces offline-only operation
- Removes hardcoded credentials
- Implements signed update mechanisms
- Ensures data privacy

### 5. DevOps Packager
- Creates APK bundles for offline distribution
- Manages assets (SQLite, FAISS index, quantized models)
- Implements reproducible builds
- Supports incremental updates

### 6. Product Goal Guardian
- Maintains focus on core functionality
- Prevents scope creep
- Ensures alignment with rural farmer needs
- Validates against performance constraints

### 7. Multilingual Accessibility Specialist
- Implements localization support
- Manages Hindi/Bhojpuri/Marathi language packs
- Ensures UTF-8 compliance
- Validates TTS functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 and Google Python Style Guide
- Include type hints and docstrings
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Optimize for minimal memory footprint

### Performance Requirements
- Maximum 500MB RAM usage
- Sub-3 second inference time
- Cold start under 5 seconds
- Minimal battery consumption

### Testing Protocol
1. Unit tests for all components
2. Integration tests for data flow
3. Performance testing on target devices
4. User acceptance testing with target demographic

### Documentation Requirements
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API documentation
- User guides in local languages
- Troubleshooting guides
  - Bias handling and evaluation metrics
  - Model packaging with clear inference pipelines
  - Model cards and ethical considerations

- **Production Architecture**
  - Cloud-ready, scalable architectures
  - CI/CD integration
  - Secure secret management
  - Environment configuration as code

#### Technical Requirements
- **Code Quality**: Follow Google, Meta, Netflix, Amazon engineering standards
- **Stack Selection**: Prioritize hackathon-viable technologies
- **Security**: No exposed credentials, proper authentication
- **Documentation**: Accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable

#### Implementation Guidelines
```
You are now acting as a MAANG-level Hackathon Project Builder. 
Given my current project repo, refactor it to be production-ready while meeting 
strict hackathon guidelines. Fix broken flows, remove unused code, ensure code 
modularity, and document only what is present in the actual project structure.
```

#### Common Tasks
- Codebase refactoring
- API and UI development
- AI pipeline implementation
- Security audits
- Documentation generation

## Version Control
- **v1.2** (2025-07-04): Added MAANG-Level Hackathon Builder Persona
- **v1.1** (2025-07-04): Added MAANG-Level Web Data Collection section
- **v1.0** (2025-07-04): Initial prompt documentation
