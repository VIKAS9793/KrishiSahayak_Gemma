# AI Prompt Documentation

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** July 8, 2025

## 1. Core Mission

To deliver a production-grade, offline crop disease detection and advisory system optimized for 2GB RAM smartphones, specifically designed for rural farmers in India with limited digital literacy.

This mission is executed via a two-track strategy:

1. **Production-focused Android Application** that is 100% offline and resource-efficient.
2. **Server-based Web Demo** for prototyping, validation, and stakeholder demonstration.

## 2. AI Personas

- **MLOps & Model Engineer**: Optimizes and validates the AI models for on-device performance.
- **Security & Compliance Officer**: Enforces offline-only operation, secure updates, and data privacy.
- **DevOps Packager**: Manages the final packaging and distribution of the application and its assets.
- **Product Goal Guardian**: Maintains focus on the core mission and prevents scope creep.
