Apple Scab
- Olive-green to brown circular spots on leaves, often with a velvety texture.
 - Leaves may become twisted, puckered, and drop prematurely.
 - Fruit develops scabby, sunken, brown spots which can crack.
- Cultural: Remove and destroy fallen leaves and fruit to reduce overwintering fungus. Prune trees to improve air circulation and hasten drying.
 - Chemical: Apply fungicides based on a schedule targeting growth stages (e.g., pink bud, petal fall). Products include Mancozeb, Captan, and Myclobutanil. A post-harvest Urea spray is also recommended in India.
 - Biological: Use of Bacillus subtilis and Trichoderma harzianum can help suppress the pathogen.

Apple Black Rot
- Leaves: "Frog-eye leaf spot" with purplish borders and tan centers.
 - Fruit: Rot begins at the blossom end, forming a black spot with concentric rings ("bull's-eye" pattern). Fruit may mummify and remain on the tree.
 - Branches: Sunken, reddish-brown cankers.
- Cultural: Prune and destroy all dead branches and cankers. Remove all mummified fruit from the tree and orchard floor.
 - Chemical: Traditional Indian remedy includes post-harvest treatment with linseed or mustard oil. Fungicides like Difenoconazole and Propiconazole have shown efficacy.

Cedar Apple Rust
- On Apple: Bright orange-yellow spots on leaves, often with red borders and tiny black dots on the surface. Finger-like tubes may appear on the underside. Fruit can have larger yellow lesions, causing it to be misshapen.
 - On Cedar/Juniper: Hard, brown galls form on twigs, which produce striking orange, gelatinous "telial horns" in wet spring weather.
- Cultural: The most effective method is removing the alternate host (cedar/juniper trees) within a radius of several kilometers, though often impractical. A more feasible approach is to prune and destroy galls from nearby cedars in late winter.
 - Host Resistance: Plant rust-resistant apple varieties like 'Redfree', 'Liberty', or 'Stayman'.
 - Chemical: Apply fungicides (e.g., Mancozeb, Myclobutanil) to apple trees when the orange horns are visible on the cedar host.

Bell Pepper Bacterial Spot
- Leaves: Small, water-soaked spots that become angular and dark-green to black, often with a yellow halo. Centers can fall out, creating a "shot-hole" look.
 - Fruit: Raised, rough, brown, or scab-like spots.
- Cultural: Use certified pathogen-free seed and transplants. Practice a 2-3 year crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops. Avoid overhead irrigation.
 - Host Resistance: Plant resistant varieties where available.
 - Chemical: Apply copper-based bactericides, often mixed with Mancozeb. Seed treatment with hot water (50Â°C for 25 mins) or sodium hypochlorite can be effective.

Cherry Powdery Mildew
- White, powdery, or cotton-like growth on leaves, shoots, and fruit.
 - Infected leaves may curl, blister, and become distorted.
 - Fruit can develop circular, depressed areas covered in the white fungus, making it unmarketable.
- Cultural: Prune to improve air circulation. Remove and destroy sucker shoots. Manage irrigation to keep foliage dry.
 - Chemical: Apply fungicides (e.g., sulfur, myclobutanil, propiconazole) from shuck fall through harvest. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action (FRAC groups) to manage resistance.
 - Organic: Potassium bicarbonate, neem oil, or milk-based sprays can be used.

Corn Gray Leaf Spot
- Long, narrow, rectangular, tan-to-gray lesions on leaves that run parallel to the veins.
 - Symptoms typically start on lower leaves and progress up the plant.
 - Severe infection can cause leaves to blight and stalks to weaken.
- Cultural: Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., beans, peas). Tillage to bury infected residue can reduce inoculum, but this conflicts with no-till conservation practices.
 - Host Resistance: Use of resistant maize hybrids is the most effective and economical strategy.
 - Chemical: Apply foliar fungicides (e.g., strobilurins like pyraclostrobin, triazoles like propiconazole) when disease first appears.

 - In humid weather, lesions may appear dark and sooty.
- Cultural: Manage crop residue through crop rotation and/or tillage to reduce the primary inoculum source.
 - Host Resistance: Use of resistant hybrids is the most economical and recommended strategy.
 - Chemical: Apply fungicides like Mancozeb or Propiconazole, especially for high-value corn.

Grape Black Rot
- Leaves: Reddish-brown circular spots with dark borders and tan centers. Tiny black dots (pycnidia) often form in a ring pattern inside the spots.
 - Fruit: Berries turn black, shrivel, and become hard, dry "mummies" covered with black pycnidia.
- Cultural: Sanitation is critical. Remove and destroy all mummified fruit and diseased canes during dormant pruning. Improve air circulation through canopy management.
 - Chemical: Apply protective fungicide sprays (e.g., Mancozeb, Copper Oxychloride) starting early in the season.

- Cultural: General fungal leaf spot management applies: vineyard sanitation (raking and destroying fallen leaves) and improving air circulation via canopy management.
 - Chemical: Fungicide programs for other diseases (e.g., Black Rot) using Mancozeb or copper-based products are likely to provide control.
